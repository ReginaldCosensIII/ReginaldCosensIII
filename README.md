# Hi there, I'm Reginald Cosens III! 👋  

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate and driven **Software Developer** with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from **Colorado Technical University (Class of 2025)**. I focus on building modern web applications, backend systems, and full-stack solutions — and I love transforming real-world problems into clean, scalable software.

Alongside my academic foundation, I work as a **freelance web developer for Computer Enhancement Systems, Inc. (CES)**, where I modernize legacy systems, enhance backend functionality, build secure web applications, and support deployments across multiple production environments. My work includes full website rebuilds, ongoing site updates, WordPress modifications, SEO improvements, UI/UX refinements, performance optimization, and general client maintenance. I also provide troubleshooting, mobile responsiveness improvements, and reliability enhancements to keep client websites secure and up-to-date.
